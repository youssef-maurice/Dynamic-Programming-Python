# Dynamic-Programming-Python

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for sequence alignment in bioinformatics and computational biology. 
It is primarily employed for aligning two sequences, such as DNA, RNA, or protein sequences, to identify regions of similarity or homology. 
The algorithm aims to find the optimal alignment by maximizing a similarity score while considering gaps (insertions or deletions) in one or both of the sequences.
